# FizzBuzz

A simple project, to start my coding journey. I have created a simple FizzBuzz challenge.

## Rules 
* A method called Fizzbuzz should take an argument
* If the number is divisible by 3 it should return:
```
Fizz
```
* If the number is divisible by 5 it should return:
```
Buzz
```
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should return:
```
FizzBuzz
```
* If the number is divisible is not divisible by 3 or 5 it should return the given number, i.e.:
```
7
```

# How to run the programme
* Type the following into the command line:
```
$ irb -r ./fizzbuzz.rb
```
* Then to call the method with a number of your choice (e.g. 3):
```
$ fizzbuzz(3)
```
* This should return the desired result, in the above case it would return:
```
"Fizz"
```

# How to run the tests
* Type the following into the command line:
```
rspec --init
```
* Then type the following:
```
rspec
```
